## Overview


Welcome to my satellite! This digital platform serves as a showcase of my journey as a software engineer, spotlighting my skills, projects, and experiences. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Java with Spring Boot for the backend, it offers visitors profound insights into my expertise and creative endeavors. Leveraging PostgreSQL for database management and Gmail SMTP protocol for seamless communication, it stands as a testament to my commitment to delivering robust and dynamic web solutions.
